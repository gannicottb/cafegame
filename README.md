cafegame
========

This is the game that will be deployed in the "Cafe" in the Google Partner Plex. 
It's all about guessing faces from gradually de-pixelating images! We need a snappy title.

Installation
============

You'll need to install Crossbar.io (the WAMP router that Autobahn|JS uses)

http://crossbar.io/docs/Quick-Start/

You should be able to run $ crossbar start in the /guesswho directory, then navigate to localhost:8080
