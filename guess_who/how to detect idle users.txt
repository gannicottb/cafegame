how to detect idle users

a user that has not answered for X consecutive rounds is considered to be idle


how do we know if they have answered?
submitGuess is the obvious place in the code to detect

we only care about consecutive answers


- keep track of their answers since logging in
- count how many rounds in a row that they have not answered
- add an Object to each user to track flags for each round that they have played?

onRoundStart -> set all users.answered = false
onGuess -> set user.answered = true, user.idle = 0
onRoundEnd -> all users with answered = false increment idle. if idle == threshold, send wakeup message. if idle > threshold, log them out

user.idle = {this_round: false, count: 0}

startNextRound{
	...
	users.map(function(user){
		user.idle.this_round = true
	})
	...
}

submitGuess{
	...
	user.idle = {this_round: false, count: 0}
	...
}

onRoundEnd{
	...
	users.filter(function(user){
		return user.idle.this_round
	}).map(function(idle_user){
		idle_user.idle.count += 1
		if (idle_user.idle.count == THRESHOLD){
			sendWakeupMessage(idle_user);
		}
		else if (idle_user.idle.count > THRESHOLD){
			onLogout([idle_user.id], {});
		}
	});
	...
}
