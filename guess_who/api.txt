Guess submission should be a publish topic, actually.
Nope, there should be an RPC call for guessing, and an event for new guesses (for the large display)

Round end and round result should be merged together -> roundOver should have a result payload
Which really means that the display should not be in charge of when the round is over.
The backend should notify all clients when the round is over, and if the large display isn't quuuuite done, it should skip to the end.

Login needs to be RPC, and the backend should publish the login event if successful
What does the large-right need to know about new users?
uid, uname
